Fujiman (Chris) has done a great service to all of us by working on a UserScript for TamperMonkey, etc. that allows a Google Meet to be busted into a "Brady Bunch" grid view that shows all participants. To make it easier on our students and teachers, I packaged it into a Chrome Extension (unpublished, because I can't offer any actual support).
Give lots of love to Chris by visiting his GreasyFork profile [https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/397862-google-meet-grid-view] or GitHub [https://github.com/Fugiman/google-meet-grid-view/tree/7caae551a9128ad4c922ce05bd24944a694691fb]

This repo uses submodules to keep pulling the latest userscript (basically, I'm just injecting his script)

So instead of just `git clone` you'll want to do `git clone -recursive` if you're installing the script locally.
